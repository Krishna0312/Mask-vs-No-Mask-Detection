# Mask-vs-No-Mask-Detection
Built an end-to-end pipeline which labels a person with or without mask in the live visual data
This repository contains a code file to implement a pipeline.
The pre-trained models (Inception ResNet V2 and Inception V3) are imported and using transfer learning they are re-trained.
A live video stream through device's web cam  can be taken to test the model.
